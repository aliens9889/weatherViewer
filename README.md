# WeatherViewer

This is a weatherViewer following the Stephen Grider tutorial to better understanding about React and Redux.

The project's objective is show a list of USA cities with a  5 days forecast data (With Map and Chart).

For this project you need to open an account on **https://openweathermap.org** and that way you could have an API KEY 
that it is necessary for this.

The difference between the original tutorial and this project is that I'm using **yarn** 
so if you going to install the dependencies you have to type this

```yarn install```

To run the project 

```yarn  start```

For the charts I'm using **https://github.com/borisyankov/react-sparklines**


For the Maps I'm using **https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps**
